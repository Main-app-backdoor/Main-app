// This file is a temporary workaround to avoid duplicate method declarations
// of resetAllAction() and resetOptionsAction() that exist in both
// SettingsViewController and its extension in ResetAlertOptions.swift

// Once the code is refactored to avoid duplicate method declarations,
// this file can be safely removed.

// Note: The implementation in ResetAlertOptions.swift is the one that should be used.
